# Access Modifiers in C++

## What are Access Modifiers?

Access modifiers are keywords that control the visibility and accessibility of class members (variables and methods) from different parts of a program. They define the scope of data encapsulation and inheritance behavior.
Access modifiers are crucial for implementing encapsulation, one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). They help protect the internal state of an object and control how it can be accessed or modified.
Access modifiers in C++ are used to set the accessibility of class members. They determine whether a member can be accessed from outside the class, from derived classes, or only within the class itself.

## Types of Access Modifiers

### 1. Public
- **Meaning**: Members are accessible from anywhere in the program
- **When to use**: For interface methods and data that should be available to all users of the class

```cpp
class Example {
public:
    int publicVar;
    void publicMethod() {
        cout << "Public method accessible everywhere" << endl;
    }
};
```

### 2. Private
- **Meaning**: Members are only accessible within the same class
- **When to use**: For implementation details that should be hidden from outside access
- **Example**: Data members or helper methods that should not be exposed to users of the class
- **Note**: If we do not specify an access modifier, the default is `private` for class members.

```cpp
class Example {
private:
    int privateVar;
    void privateMethod() {
        cout << "Only accessible within this class" << endl;
    }
};
```

### 3. Protected
- **Meaning**: Members are accessible within the class and its derived classes
- **When to use**: For data/methods that should be inherited but not publicly accessible

```cpp
class Example {
protected:
    int protectedVar;
    void protectedMethod() {
        cout << "Accessible in this class and derived classes" << endl;
    }
};
```

## Access Modifiers in Inheritance

### Parent Class Example
```cpp
class Parent {
public:
    int publicData = 10;
protected:
    int protectedData = 20;
private:
    int privateData = 30;
    
public:
    void showData() {
        cout << "Public: " << publicData << endl;
        cout << "Protected: " << protectedData << endl;
        cout << "Private: " << privateData << endl;
    }
};
```

### Child Class Behavior
```cpp
class Child : public Parent {
public:
    void accessParentMembers() {
        publicData = 100;     // ✅ Accessible
        protectedData = 200;  // ✅ Accessible
        // privateData = 300; // ❌ Error: Not accessible
    }
};
```

## Inheritance Access Levels

### Public Inheritance
```cpp
class Child : public Parent {
    // public members remain public
    // protected members remain protected
    // private members are not accessible
};
```

### Protected Inheritance
```cpp
class Child : protected Parent {
    // public members become protected
    // protected members remain protected
    // private members are not accessible
};
```

### Private Inheritance
```cpp
class Child : private Parent {
    // public members become private
    // protected members become private
    // private members are not accessible
};
```

## Key Differences Summary

| Access Modifier | Same Class  | Derived Class | Outside Class  |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| Public          | ✅         | ✅            | ✅            |
| Protected       | ✅         | ✅            | ❌            |
| Private         | ✅         | ❌            | ❌            |

## Best Practices

1. **Default to private**: Make members private unless they need to be accessible
2. **Use protected for inheritance**: When derived classes need access but external code doesn't
3. **Minimize public interface**: Only expose what's necessary for the class's intended use
4. **Prefer public inheritance**: Most common and intuitive inheritance pattern
