# Python Variables

## What are Variables?
Variables are containers for storing data values. In Python, you don't need to declare the type of a variable; it is inferred based on the value assigned.

### Example:
```python
x = 5
y = "Hello"
print(x)  # Output: 5
print(y)  # Output: Hello
```

---

## Rules for Naming Variables
1. Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore (`_`).
2. They cannot start with a number.
3. Variable names can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`).
4. Variable names are case-sensitive (`age`, `Age`, and `AGE` are different).

---

## Types of Variables
Python variables can hold different types of data, such as:

- **Integer**: `x = 10`
- **Float**: `y = 3.14`
- **String**: `name = "Alice"`
- **Boolean**: `is_active = True`

## Visual Representation

### Memory Allocation
Each variable points to a memory location where its value is stored.

```plaintext
+---------+       +-------+
| Variable| ----> | Value |
+---------+       +-------+
|    x    |       |   5   |
+---------+       +-------+
```

### Example Code:
```python
x = 5
y = "Hello"
```

### Visualization:
```plaintext
+---------+       +-------+
| Variable| ----> | Value |
+---------+       +-------+
|    x    |       |   5   |
|    y    |       | Hello |
+---------+       +-------+
```

## Dynamic Typing
Python is dynamically typed, meaning you can change the type of a variable at runtime.

### Example:
```python
x = 10       # x is an integer
x = "Python" # Now x is a string
```

---

## Static Typing
Python supports static typing through the use of type hints introduced in Python 3.5. Type hints allow you to specify the expected type of a variable, but they are not enforced at runtime. Instead, they are used for better code readability and by static analysis tools like `mypy`.

### Example:
```python
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

x: int = 10
y: str = "Hello"
```

### Benefits of Static Typing:
1. Improves code readability and maintainability.
2. Helps catch type-related errors during development.
3. Enables better support from IDEs and linters.

---

## Constants
Although Python does not have built-in constant types, you can use naming conventions (e.g., all uppercase) to indicate a variable should not be changed.

### Example:
```python
PI = 3.14159
```

---

## Best Practices
1. Use meaningful variable names (`age` instead of `a`).
2. Follow naming conventions (e.g., `snake_case` for variables).
3. Avoid overwriting built-in names (e.g., `list`, `str`).
