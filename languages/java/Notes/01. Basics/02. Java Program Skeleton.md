# Basic Java Program Skeleton

A simple Java program typically looks like this:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## Explanation of Each Line

- `public class Main {`
  - Declares a public class named `Main`. Every Java application must have at least one class definition.
- `public static void main(String[] args) {`
  - The main method. This is the entry point of any Java application. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) calls this method to start the program.
  - `public`: The method is accessible from anywhere.
  - `static`: The method can be run without creating an instance of the class.
  - `void`: The method does not return any value.
  - `String[] args`: Command-line arguments passed as an array of strings.
- `System.out.println("Hello, World!");`
  - Prints the text "Hello, World!" to the console.
- `}`
  - Closing braces mark the end of the method and class blocks.

## How to Run This Program

1. **Save the Code**  
   Save the above code in a file named `Main.java`. The filename must match the class name.

2. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**  
   Navigate to the directory where you saved `Main.java`.

3. **Compile the Program**  
   Run the following command to compile the Java file:
   ```
   javac Main.java
   ```
   This will generate a `Main.class` file in the same directory.

4. **Run the Program**  
   Execute the compiled program with:
   ```
   java Main
   ```
   You should see the output:
   ```
   Hello, World!
   ```

## Summary

- Every Java program starts execution from the `main` method.
- The class name should match the filename.
- Statements inside the `main` method define the program's behavior.
- Java is case-sensitive and uses braces `{}` to define code blocks.
