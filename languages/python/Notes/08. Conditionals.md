# Conditionals in Python

Conditionals allow you to execute specific blocks of code based on certain conditions.

## `if` Statement
The `if` statement evaluates a condition and executes the block of code if the condition is `True`.

```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
```

## `if-else` Statement
The `if-else` statement provides an alternative block of code if the condition is `False`.

```python
x = 3
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")
```

## `if-elif-else` Statement
The `if-elif-else` statement allows multiple conditions to be checked sequentially.

```python
x = 7
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
elif x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 10")
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")
```

## Nested Conditionals
Conditionals can be nested within each other.

```python
x = 8
if x > 5:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        print("x is greater than 5 and even")
```

# Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is a shorthand for `if-else` statements. It allows you to write conditional expressions in a single line.

## Syntax
```python
value_if_true if condition else value_if_false
```

## Example
```python
x = 10
result = "Even" if x % 2 == 0 else "Odd"
print(result)  # Output: Even
```

## Use Cases
- Simplifying simple `if-else` statements.
- Assigning values based on conditions in a concise manner.

# Best Practices
1. Use ternary operators for simple conditions to improve readability.
2. Avoid nesting ternary operators as it can make the code harder to understand.
3. Use proper indentation and comments for complex conditional logic.
